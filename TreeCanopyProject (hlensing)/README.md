# TreeCanopyProject

## Mid-term Project (Presentation File Submission) 
*(Due 4:30pm Tuesday, October 12, 2021)*

The mid-term presentation needs to provide details of what you aim to do for your final project (i.e., "project proposal").  

The mid-term project needs to specify: 
- Research or practical question/problem that is related to S&CC: does the proposed project aim to address, solve, or articulate a reasonably-defind S&CC problem? (20 %)
- Potential stakeholders of your project: does the proposal specify and analyze the potential stakeholder in a justifiable way? (20 %)
- Justifications on the importance of the problems: does the proposal provide appropriate justifications on why the proposed S&CC problem is important to the stakeholders? (20 %)
- Technological or methodological soundness: does the proposal provide reasonable technological or data scientific solutions to address the proposed problem? (20 %)
- Website layout (low-fidelity design): does the proposal provide the website layout (low-fidelity design) in a way that would (1) address the proposed problem and (2) appeal to the stakeholders? (20 %) 

For the website layout, if the team wants, it is possible to submit the design separately to communicate the details better (but this is optional -- presenting the web layout as part of the presentation is totally fine). 

Each team member needs to submit the presentation file (and/or design layout document) through BB. Each of the two members within a team needs to submit the same files, respectively.
